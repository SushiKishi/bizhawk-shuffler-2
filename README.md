#You're probably looking for the branches.
Other than this readme file, this main branch is an identical fork of [AuthorBlues Bizhawk Shuffler 2](https://github.com/authorblues/bizhawk-shuffler-2/tree/main) as of 4/13/2025.

The available branches are as follows:

* timer-swap branch -- Modifiable Swap Timers plugin. Control the minimum and maximum swap timers using text files instead of the Shuffler's configuration screen.
* boosted-swaps branch -- Adds a Weighted Odds shuffle option. The longer a game goes without being selected, the more likely it is to be selected next. May help the shuffler "feel" more randomized.
* temp-goods -- Temporary Goods plugin. Makes it much easier to 'hotswap' games into, out of, then back into (that's the tricky party) the game list. Useful for donation incentives or viewer redemptions, e.g. "Donate $X.00 to add Y loops of Donkey Kong to the Shuffler."
